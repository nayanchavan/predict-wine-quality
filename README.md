# predict-wine-quality
Data science modeling project to find which feature in the red wine dataset had the most positive correlation with overall wine quality. 

In this project, I will use the following three models: (1) Ordinary Least Squares, (2) Ridge Regression, and (3) Lasso Regression to find the coefficients of each of the linear models to relate the wine quality to the other features in the wine dataset. The source code for all my findings can be found and cited throughout this notebook. Each model's section within the notebook contains explanations to accompany code cells.
